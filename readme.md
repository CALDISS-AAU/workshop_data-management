# Data Management with OpenRefine and Pandas



*Workshop for Digital Curriculum 2021, August 20th*



This workshop is part of [the competency development workshop series for Digital Curriculum 2021](https://digitalcurriculum.au.dk/course-information/).

The workshop is cloned and modified from the Data Carpentry workshop: [OpenRefine for Social Science Data](https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/).



## Preparations for the workshop



### Installing OpenRefine

OpenRefine is free to download from [the OpenRefine website](https://openrefine.org/download.html). There are versions for Windows, Mac and Linux. Note that the Windows version requires Java to be installed. Also note that unlike most software, there is no installation file. You simply have to download the files and extract the contents in some way (depending on your operating system).

OpenRefine runs via your default browser.

Make sure to have OpenRefine downloaded on your computer and confirm that it can launch before the workshop. 

See the [setup instructions from Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/setup.html) for further details.



### Data used in the workshop

The data used for this workshop is a teaching version of the Studying African Farmer-Led Irrigation (SAFI) database. The SAFI dataset represents interviews of farmers in two countries in eastern sub-Saharan Africa (Mozambique and Tanzania). These interviews were conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 and probed household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household members), agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), and assets (e.g. number and types of livestock).

The data used in this workshop is a subset of the teaching version that has been intentionally ‘messed up’ for this lesson.

Make sure to download the data file to your computer by [clicking this link](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11502815). (direct link: https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/11502815). Note where you store the file on your computer, as you will have to be able to find it again during the workshop.



### Installation and preparation support
